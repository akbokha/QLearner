### QLearner
An implementation of the Q-learning Algorithm

- based on the explanation provided in the book of Ertel: [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319584867)
- Instead of randomly selecting a state *s* and selecting/carrying out actions according to this random choice, one or more path(s) is/are specified.
- No time-limits / convergence checks are integrated into the implementation. The algorithm iterates a pre-specified number of times over the aforementioned paths.
